- Edit the template pages we've provided in the `docs/` folder to pertain to your own tool.  
- As you make changes you can run `mkdocs build` and then `mkdocs serve` to see a preview.  
- When you are ready to publish your documentation to its own website, run [`mkdocs gh-deploy`](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/), it will return the web address of your new site.
