How-to Examples/Vignettes Download a template document for a How-to Example - [ ] Is easy to find: clearly visible on the main page. - [ ] Demonstrates examples that are the most common use case(s). - [ ] Prerequisite knowledge needed is described. - [ ] Links to helpful background knowledge resources are included. - [ ] Paste-able or directly runnable code is given and can be run as-is. - [ ] Demonstrates a reproducible example. - [ ] An example dataset needed is provided and introduced. - [ ] No additional packages and software are required beyond what is installed in the Getting Started . Reference Guides Download a template document for a Reference Guide - [ ] Is easy to find: clearly visible on the main page. - [ ] Is searchable or at least visually easily able to be scanned. - [ ] All items are described in clear language: Command line items [ ] All functions are described. [ ] All arguments of those functions are described. [ ] All parameters are described and defaults explained. [ ] Any additional datasets or items included in the package are documented.
